# odin_recipes
This is the first project that I have done while going through odin project.
This project has three recipe links in the homepage, clicking on any one of them will lead you to the respective recipe page that has the food image and the ingrediants and the steps to reproduce the recipe.
This is entirely basic html code and nothing else.
It was fun building something after going through so much theory in the odin project curriculum.
