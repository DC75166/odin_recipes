    <h2>The ultimate bengali delicacy</h2>
    <p>
        Luchis are made from finely milled flour (maida), unlike puris, which are usually
        made from whole-wheat flour (atta) in several parts of the sub-continent. 
        What makes a good luchi is its flaky interior and crispy exterior.Rolling 
        perfectly round luchis is a skill and it is absolutely alright if you don't get 
        it right the first time. Like every skill, this too develops with time and
        effort. Yet, what remains unchanged is the versatility of this dish—you can pair
        it with meat, dal, or even with a simple potato curry. In fact, there are many 
        Bengali households where luchi is eaten just with sugar.

    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200 g maida (all-purpose flour)</li>
        <li>4 g salt</li>
        <li>10 g sugar</li>
        <li>15 g vegetable oil/ghee</li>
        <li>100-110 g hot water</li>
        <li>vegetable oil for deep-frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take maida in a mixing bowl, with salt, sugar, and oil/ghee. 
            Distribute the oil evenly so that a fistful of flour when pressed together
            retains its shape.</li>
        <li>Add water and knead the flour for 10 minutes. The dough may seem a little 
            tacky at first, but it will come together in the end. Cover and rest for
            30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 20 equal portions (of about 16 g each). Rest these 
            again for 10 minutes to relax the dough.</li>
        <li>When you are ready to roll the luchis out, heat vegetable oil in a kadai
             for deep-frying.</li>
        <li>Oil your rolling surface and rolling pin, and roll the luchis into flat 
            discs of about 10 cm diameter.</li>
        <li>Carefully lower the luchi (one at a time if you are a beginner) into hot oil
           (oil temp: ~220°C). Press down gently and rotate to help it puff.
            Flip, and fry the other side.</li>
        <li>Drain from the oil and serve hot with begun bhaja, mutton kosha, or anything
            you like.</li>
    </ol>
